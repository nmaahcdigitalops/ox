## Timeline
For the purpose of communicating an acquisition timeline, the Smithsonian Institution anticipates releasing the Request for Proposal on/around November 1, 2019. 

## Acquisition Strategies
_vendors - Which strategy makes the most sense? Are the pros and cons correct? Which pros and cons are missing? What additional strategies should we think about?_

#### Acquisition Strategy A (SI has chosen this strategy)  
One award for discovery, light-weight prototype (required tasks), then optional task to build an MVP for 8-12 month PoP, then multiple award terms to further develop the product.  
__Pros:__ Most simple procurement approach. Minimizes overhead to both SI and vendor.  
__Cons:__ Fewer ideas for discovery and light-weight prototype. Fewer opportunities to see new SI vendors deliver value, which could have been helpful if SI's vision is to build a number of additional digital products during the next few years.    

##### 1 award
* Overall Scope: digital product MVP and follow-on development
* Base Period
  * PoP: 4-8 weeks
  * Scope: Discovery sprint + light-weight prototype(s)
* Option Period 1
  * PoP: 6 months
  * Scope: Digital product MVP
* Award Term
  * PoP: 6 months
  * Scope: Further product development
* Award Term
  * PoP: 6 months
  * Scope: Further product development

#### Acquisition Strategy B (SI decided not to pursue this strategy)  
Multiple initial awards, then one larger award  
__Pros:__ Multiple initial light-weight prototypes  
__Cons:__ Potential delay or break in schedule between the end of first award and the beginning of larger award, leading to a dip in inertia. Multi-awards process would increase proposal and business development costs for vendors.  

##### ~~1. <=3 small awards (<=$30,000/award)~~
* ~~Scope: Discovery sprint + light-weight prototype~~
* ~~PoP: 2-4 weeks~~
##### ~~2. 1 larger award (ball park of team size = 8?)
* ~~Scope: digital product MVP and follow-on development~~
  * ~~Base Period~~
    * ~~PoP: 6-10 months~~
    * ~~Scope: Digital Prodcut MVP~~
  * ~~Award Term 1~~
    * ~~PoP: 6 months~~
    * ~~Scope: Further product development~~
  * ~~Award Term 2~~
    * ~~PoP: 6 months~~
    * ~~Scope: Further product development~~
  * ~~Award Term 3~~
    * ~~PoP: 6 months~~
    * ~~Scope: Further product development~~
  
#### Acquisition Strategy C (SI decided not to pursue this strategy)  
Multiple initial awards, where each awardee performs two initial tasks - discovery and a light-weight prototype - both within a brief initial PoP. After each awardee completes those initial taks, the agency will make a decision on which (only one) vendor continues work by only exercising the option period for one of the contracts. The others vendors option periods will not be exercised.

__Pros:__ Multiple initial light-weight prototypes. No procurement-related delay in performance between Task 1 (discovery and light-weight prototype) and subsequent tasks. Vendors get to deliver something of value, while getting paid, and getting to know the agency in the process. Compared to Acquisition Strategy B, Strategy C has reduced overhead costs for SI and vendors since this strategy is for 1 competition versus 2 competitions.  
__Cons:__ Potentially a staffing-related delay for the vendor in between Task 1 (discovery and light-weight prototype) and the next task due to the uncertainty of Option 1 being exercised.  

##### ~~<=3 awards~~
* ~~Overall Scope: digital product MVP and follow-on development~~
* ~~Base Period~~
  * ~~PoP: 2-4 weeks~~
  * ~~Scope: Discovery sprint + light-weight prototype~~
* ~~Option Period 1 (only one of the awardees will have this option exercised)~~
  * ~~PoP: 6 months~~
  * ~~Scope: Digital product MVP~~
* ~~Award Term~~
  * ~~PoP: 6 months~~
  * ~~Scope: Further product development~~
* ~~Award Term~~
  * ~~PoP: 6 months~~
  * ~~Scope: Further product development~~
<br/><br/>

## Period of Performance
The anticipated base Period of Performance (PoP) is 3 weeks from contract award date (anticipated __ ______ 2019) through __ ______ 2020.  
The majority of the work will be conducted offsite at the Vendor’s facilities, provided the Offeror has reliable remote communication capabilities and maintains regular agile ceremonies (Stand-Up, Sprint Demos, Sprint Retros, etc) with SI, at the direction of the Product Owner. Additionally, the Vendor should anticipate travel as necessary to support user research activities, in multiple geographic locations throughout the Continental United States (CONUS).
<br/><br/>

## Pricing
The Government anticipates an initial period of performance to be time and materials (T&M), for the purposes of normalizing velocity and maintaing other important performace factors (such as appropriate bug rate levels). It is anticipated that T&M will be used for the Base Period, Discovery sprint + light-weight prototype(s), and approximately the first 2-3 months of Period 2, Digital product MVP. This would be followed by a firm-fixed price (FFP) contract type for remaining periods of performce. More specifically, the FFP periods will be FFP per iteration.

## How to Pitch and How to Be Judged

### How to Pitch
_vendors - What are we getting wrong here? Will this or another approach lead to a more effective way to both tell and show your capabilities to help solve the problem statement in the SOO? Please suggest alternative approaches. Is the lightness/heaviness of the'lift' and BD expense for you as a vendor appropriate at each phase yet effective enough to draw a line in the sand at the end of each stage? Should the advisory down-select be moved to a different stage? Removed all together?_ 
##### Phase 1  - Request for White Paper
* 7-page white paper
  * The focus here is around previous demonstrability of the Digital Services Playbook. Tell specific stories to show how your company (or individuals at your company) have brought those plays to life.
  * The Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture is seeking interested vendors to submit white papers in response to the needs addressed in this Statement of Objectives. The white paper should includes at least 2 projects that are not just relevant to the SOO, but also explain relevance to the [Digital Services Playbook](https://playbook.cio.gov/). For each project, explain the 'why', 'how', and 'what'. Interested vendors should prepare a response, no more than seven (7) pages including any exhibits or appendices, for submission no later than (month) (day), 2019 in accordance with the attached template. For each project, explain how your organization formed as one team with the client to deliver the product. For each project, explain how it contributed to the larger goal of improving the digital services ecosystem in Government. The Government will confirm receipt of each vendor’s white paper within 24 hours of submission; if you do not receive a confirmation in that period, please contact the Attorney/Advisor immediately. No submissions will be accepted after the deadline ((month) (day), 2019) regardless of circumstances.
* All vendors with questions must submit the questions, in writing, to the Attorney/Advisor by (month) (day), 2019. All questions, along with the Government responses, will be published to all participating vendors within 48 hours. The Government is unable to answer any questions privately or after these deadlines under Federal law and regulations.
* The Government will review white papers and select one or more vendors to continue in the process outlined below.

##### Phase 2 - Interviews/Meetings
* Interviews/Meetings can be in-person at NMAAHC or remote, and within approximately 2 weeks from submission of white papers
* Part 1 - 45 min Interview: questions and answers about your company and/or white paper
* Part 2 - 60 min Epic(s) Exercise: - Walk SI through, at least verbally, how you would approach the epic(s) provided to you at the end of Phase 1 when your organization was informed that it would continue in the process to Phase 2.
  * You will have between the end of Phase 1 and the Phase 2 Interviews/Meetings to put together a walk-through of how you would take one or several of the epic examples below from concept to production if you were working in the real environment. This should include at least design, user experience, and agile development process you would use to ensure successful implementation. You can focus on any particular part of the process you want to highlight and during the  time you may use props/supplies, or anything else that will help you highlight how your team would execute this example as if you were hired to complete it. You may not include any more team members than those that will be present (in person or virtually) with you to the Phase 2 interview/meeting.
    * Epic A: The epic will be provided at the end of Phase 1, and only provided to the vendors that are allowed to continue in the process to Phase 2. Indicate any assumptions made since you did not have access to SI for this process.
          * Acceptance Criteria: Use your creativity and come up with an appropriate acceptance criteria for this epic.
    * Epic B: The epic will be provided at the end of Phase 1, and only provided to the vendors that are allowed to continue in the process to Phase 2. Indicate any assumptions made since you did not have access to SI for this process.
          * Acceptance Criteria: Use your creativity and come up with an appropriate acceptance criteria for this epic.
* The Government will have a down-select at the end of Phase 2 and select one or more vendors to continue in the process outlined below.

##### Phase 3
* Due Diligence Session
  * Schedule: To be announced after Phase 2. The Government will get in touch with you individually to work out a timeslot.
  * The time limit for the due diligence is 1 hour for each vendor.
  * Location: Your collaboration method: – you will set it up!
    * Zoom works great, but we don’t suggest the free version due to it cutting out after 40 minutes.
    * Skype and other VTC solutions may not work with SI firewalls.
    * Conference calls work too
  * This is an individual meeting between the government and each vendor who the Government informed will continue past Phase 2
  * This meeting is considered a site visit and is a non-evaluated step. No comments, information, or questions presented by the vendor will be considered in the evaluation. This time is open to the vendor to ask questions in order to limit the amount of assumptions that will be included as part of the offeror’s technical or price solutions. 
  * These communications are confidential. If a question or comment leads to additional information being discussed that could be critical to others the government will issue a solicitation amendment ensuring all vendors are aware of the information so they can present their best solutions.
  * This is a non-evaluated step.
* Technical Approach (to include resumes)
* Price
* Past performance/experience (not just corporate)
* Technical Approach (to include resumes)
* Price
* Past performance/experience (not just corporate)

### How to be judged

#### Technical Evaluation Criteria
1. Technical Approach: The Government's confidence that the vendor's approach (including white paper submission, interviews/meetings, and technical approach submission) will successfully fulfill the Statements of Objectives and follow modern technology best practices, such as the Digital Services Playbook. Offerors must demonstrate their understanding of the Government’s requirement and approach to performing the work by providing a detailed description of the proposed services it determines appropriate to satisfy the Government's requirement as defined in the Statement of Objectives.   
2. Past Experience: Vendor's Past Experience will be evaluated to determine the offeror’s likelihood that the offeror will be successful in the performance of a contract to be awarded by the Government.  
3. Price: (more content to be added here)  


### Written Proposal Preparation

The proposal shall conform to solicitation provisions and be prepared in accordance with this section. To aid in evaluation, the proposal shall be clearly and concisely written, as well as being neat, indexed (cross-indexed as appropriate) and logically assembled.  All pages of each section shall be appropriately numbered and identified with the name of the Offeror, the date, and the solicitation number. 

Vendors shall electronically submit a two-volume written proposal, which shall be divided and marked as follows:

Volume I - Technical Approach, Management Approach, and Past Experience
Volume II - Price Proposal

A Contractor who fails to submit a responsive proposal (Volumes I and II) at the time of proposal submission will be rejected from further consideration.  

#### Confidence Ratings Method
For Factor 1, Technical Approach, and Factor 2, Past Experience, the Government will assess its level of confidence that the vendor will successfully perform the requirements based on their approach.  One of the following confidence ratings will be assigned.  

Rating|Rating Details|
-----------|----|
__High Confidence__|The Government has high confidence that the Offeror understands the requirement, proposes a sound approach, and will be successful in performing the contract with little or no Government intervention.|
__Some Confidence__|The Government has some confidence that the Offeror understands the requirement, proposes a sound approach, and will be successful in performing the contract with some Government intervention.|
__Low Confidence__|The Government has low confidence that the Offeror understands the requirement, proposes a sound approach, and will be successful in performing the contract with even with Government intervention.|

Options  
The Government will evaluate vendors for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced or inappropriate. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

Notice of Award  
A written notice of award or acceptance of an vendor emailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Vendor within the time for acceptance specified in the proposal, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the vendor’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an proposal), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

Award Without Discussions  
The Government intends to award without discussions. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions and permit vendors to revise their proposals if it is in the best interest of the Government to do so.

Exchanges with Best-Suited Vendor  
Once the government determines the Offeror that is best-suited (i.e. the apparent successful Offeror), the government reserves the right to communicate with only that Offeror to address any remaining issues, if necessary, and finalize a contract with that Offeror. These issues may include technical and price. If the parties cannot successfully address any remaining issues, as determined pertinent at the sole discretion of the government, the government reserves the right to communicate with the next best-suited Vendor based on the original analysis and address any remaining issues.

### Clauses
(coming soon)
### Other

__Award Term Incentive__  
For this task order the Government will offer Award Term Options which may encompass future enhancements, releases, development efforts, or operations & maintenance related to the establishment of the platform or the application. Award Terms may only be awarded for an overall “Excellent” performance rating based on mutually accepted metrics. The Government will appoint an Award Term Determining Official (AFDO) who will provide the official performance review and approval for an Award Term Option to be exercised. The AFDO, in conjunction with the Attorney/Advisor, will make a unilateral decision as to the exclusion of any portion of the performance period from the evaluation of ratings and calculation of the award term. Award Term Options are not required to be consecutive with the previous period of performance of the base period or additional options. They are contingent on continued Government requirements and funding availability for the platform or application. Award Term Options must adhere to the proposed Agile methodology and processes as awarded at the contract level unless an exception is provided by the Attorney/Advisor prior to award.  

__Other Direct Costs__  
The Vendor may recommend and procure major technical software development tools and resources necessary in support of the digital product maintenance and feature developments. The Vendor shall submit a minimum of three (3) competitive price quotes
to support the price quote submitted for expenditures supporting Offeror to the COR or
other SI Authorized Agent for review and validation of need prior to purchase. The Vendor shall obtain written electronic approval prior to proceeding with expenditures in support of the digital product, approval or denial shall be granted within 3 business days of receiving a request. Preference shall be given for open-source tools and resources with active community contribution and proven security reliability. In no event shall the Vendor be authorized to purchase equipment that exceeds the ODC amount funded on the contract.
