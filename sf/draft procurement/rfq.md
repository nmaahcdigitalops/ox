## Slavery and Freedom Digital Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

## Acquisition Strategies
_vendors - Which strategy makes the most sense? Are the pros and cons correct? Which pros and cons are missing? What additional strategies should we think about?_

#### Acquisition Strategy A  
One award for discovery, light-weight prototype (required tasks), then optional task to build an MVP for 8-12 month PoP, then multiple award terms to further develop the product.  
__Pros:__ Most simple procurement approach.  
__Cons:__ Fewer ideas for discovery and light-weight prototype. Fewer opportunities to see new SI vendors deliver value, which could have been helpful if SI's vision is to build a number of additional digital products during the next few years.  

##### 1 award
* Overall Scope: digital product MVP and follow-on development
* Base Period
  * PoP: 2-4 weeks
  * Scope: Discovery sprint + light-weight prototype
* Option Period 1
  * PoP: 6 months
  * Scope: Digital product MVP
* Award Term
  * PoP: 6 months
  * Scope: Further product development
* Award Term
  * PoP: 6 months
  * Scope: Further product development

#### Acquisition Strategy B  
Multiple initial awards, then one larger award  
__Pros:__ Multiple initial light-weight prototypes  
__Cons:__ Potential delay or break in schedule between the end of first award and the beginning of larger award, leading to a dip in inertia.    

##### 1. <=3 small awards (<=$30,000/award)
* Scope: Discovery sprint + light-weight prototype
* PoP: 2-4 weeks
##### 2. 1 larger award (ball park of team size = 8?)
* Scope: digital product MVP and follow-on development
  * Base Period
    * PoP: 6-10 months
    * Scope: Digital Prodcut MVP
  * Award Term 1
    * PoP: 6 months
    * Scope: Further product development
  * Award Term 2
    * PoP: 6 months
    * Scope: Further product development
  * Award Term 3
    * PoP: 6 months
    * Scope: Further product development
  
#### Acquisition Strategy C  
Multiple initial awards, where each awardee performs two initial tasks - discovery and a light-weight prototype - both within a brief initial PoP. After each awardee completes those initial taks, the agency will make a decision on which (only one) vendor continues work by only exercising the option period for one of the contracts. The others vendors option periods will not be exercised.

__Pros:__ Multiple initial light-weight prototypes. No procurement-related delay in performance between Task 1 (discovery and light-weight prototype) and subsequent tasks. Vendors get to deliver something of value, while getting paid, and getting to know the agency in the process.  
__Cons:__ Potentially a staffing-related delay for the vendor in between Task 1 (discovery and light-weight prototype) and the next task due to the uncertainty of Option 1 being exercised.  

##### <=3 awards
* Overall Scope: digital product MVP and follow-on development
* Base Period
  * PoP: 2-4 weeks
  * Scope: Discovery sprint + light-weight prototype
* Option Period 1 (only one of the awardees will have this option exercised)
  * PoP: 6 months
  * Scope: Digital product MVP
* Award Term
  * PoP: 6 months
  * Scope: Further product development
* Award Term
  * PoP: 6 months
  * Scope: Further product development

## How to Pitch and How to Be Judged

### How to Pitch
_vendors - What are we getting wrong here? Will this or another approach lead to a more effective way to both tell and show your capabilities to help solve the problem statement in the SOO? Please suggest alternative approaches. Is the lightness/heaviness of the'lift' and BD expense for you as a vendor appropriate at each phase yet effective enough to draw a line in the sand at the end of each stage? Should the advisory down-select be moved to a different stage? Removed all together?_ 

##### Phase 1  - Request for Written Proposal

_**Details:** All vendors may choose the response format that best addresses the below requests – deck, PDF, or Word document. While we are not including length requirements, please maintain brevity where possible._

_**Questions:** All vendors with questions must submit them, in writing, to the Attorney/Advisor by (month) (day), 2019. All questions, along with the Government responses, will be published publicly within 48 hours. The Government is unable to answer any questions privately or after these deadlines under Federal law and regulations._

* Company Background
  * Please provide high-level background on your firm. Include your location, capabilities and services, relevant honors and awards, and any relevant clients (current or past). 
  Location
* Case Studies
  * Please provide 2-3 brief case studies. Your work examples should highlight your ability to:
    * A) follow the "plays" and successful practices detailed in the USDS Digital Services Playbook
    * B) use design thinking and modern technology to create a product that delivers on client objectives and user needs
    * C) and build digital products designed to educate, or work with educational institutions and museums.
* Initial Recommendations
  * Based on our Statement of Objectives, provide 2-3 recommendations for features, design approaches, and/or general functionality. You may use inspiration from your own portfolio of work, creative inspiration from around the web (i.e. a moodboard), or create low-fidelity spec that visually describes your recommendation.
* Approach
  * Based on the details in the SOO and RFQ, please provide your project approach. Please include any project management philosphies, projected phased activities, and anticipated deliverables. You may include a rough timeline if you see fit. 
* Team & Pricing
  * Please provide a breakdown of projected pricing, including all requisiting staffing and hard costs.      

##### Phase 2 - Feedback & Additional Q&A

* The NMAAHC team will provide initial feedback based on your written response. They may ask questions or request clarifications about parts of your response. Answers to questions and clarifications are due ______, 2019.
* Your firm will also have the opportunity to ask additional questions, which are due ______, 2019. 


##### Phase 3 - In-Person Presentation

_You will be notified if you make it through to the in-person presentation round via email._

* Select vendors will be invited to come to the museum for an in-person presentation. The presentation will be  75 minutes, roughly following the below agenda:
  * Introductions (5 minutes)
  * Agency Overview (5 minutes)
  * Case Study Deep Dive (10 minutes)
    * This is an opportunity to walk NMAAHC personnel through a recent project end-to-end. You should highlight the ways in which your approach followed the "plays" details in the USDS Digital Services Playbook, how you delivered on client objectives, and what technical and creative choices you made to ensure success.
  * Creative Challenge (25 minutes)
    * The current physical Slavery and Freedom Exhibit at NMAAHC explores the complex story of slavery and freedom which rests at the core of our nation’s shared history. The exhibition begins in 15th century Africa and Europe, and extends through the nation’s transformation during the Civil War and Reconstruction. Your challenge: capture the feeling, the emotional response, and the educational opportunities of the _very_ beginning of that journey, just as you step off the elevators. Create 3-4 specs (static or animated) that reveal how it comes to life visually and technically on the web. Please provide annotations or be prepared to describe how inclusivity, discovery, and empathy guided your thinking. 
  * Q&A (30 minutes)
