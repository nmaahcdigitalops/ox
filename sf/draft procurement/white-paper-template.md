Describe the technical approach that you plan to take in this proposal, taking care to highlight the information required in the Statement of Objectives.  This approach should also describe any preferred tools, platforms, processes, etc., that you plan to use.  

### Facilities and Personnel  
Describe the principal facilities and key personnel (if applicable) that will be participating in the contract if it was awarded to you.  Make sure to highlight relevant experience that they have.  It’s OK if not all personnel are decided yet, however, it’s important to describe the more senior people that you expect to be working on the contract.  

### Data Rights and Intellectual Property  
If there are any data rights concerns or limitations that would prevent you from offering the Government unlimited rights or potentially assigning copyright to the Government, outline them here.  The Government may require that code developed under this project be released under an open source license and intends to negotiate intellectual property terms consistent with that goal (including unlimited rights).  
### Small Business Participation  
If you are a small business, please describe your formation, overall size, and whether you are listed in any business development or socio-economic programs with the Small Business Administration (SBA).
