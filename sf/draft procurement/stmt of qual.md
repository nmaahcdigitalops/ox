Note About This Draft  

The Smithsonian Institution (SI) intends to release a Statement of Qualification on FBO.gov on/around Thursday, Oct. 24. The SI requests comments, questions __and especially suggested edits__ about this Draft Statement of Qualification by 9:00AM EST on Tuesday, Oct. 22 via github or via email to Jill Roberts at RobertsJRJ2@si.edu and Brent Maravilla at bmaravilla@omb.eop.gov. With an eye on eventually obtaining quotes from vendors that approach technology in line with the [Digital Services Playbook](https://playbook.cio.gov), we want to understand how this exercise is either not stringent enough or too stringent.

__DRAFT STATEMENT OF QUALIFICATION__  

The Smithsonian Institution (SI) intends to release a Request for Proposal on or around 11/1/2019 for a Digital Minimum Viable Product for Slavery and Freedom. Interested vendors shall follow the steps below. This posting is not a Request for Proposal. The purpose of this Statement of Qualification is to encourage participation in this procurement from only those vendors who have a solid commitment to building technology for their government clients according to the Digital Services Playbook. Vendors who may not yet have this commitment are strongly DISCOURAGED to respond because they are not the best fit.

1. Respond with a 1-page Statement of Qualifications via email to (fill in here) by 15 calendar days of this posting (by 9:00AM EST).  
2. For background information, see the draft Statements of Objectives, the draft Request for Proposal, and other additional infomation in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/nmaahcdigital/ox/tree/master/sf/draft%20procurement.  
3. The government intends to review responses to this qualifications statement, and will provide the anticipated Request for Proposal to only those vendors whom the government has decided has met the minimum qualifications.  
4. Minimum Qualifications: However, only vendors that respond 'yes' to all of the below bullet points will receive the eventual Request for Proposal and will be allowed to participate in this procurement. Next to each bullet point below, answer 'yes' to indicate that the statement is true for your company or indicate 'no' to indicate that the statement is not completely true for your company.  

The bullet points below ensure that the size of the vendor is adequate for this particular work, and that the anticipated price proposal is in the same 'ballpark' as the government budget.  

* Does your company have adequate size to successfully deliver the digital product (5-7 FTEs minimum)?
* Does your company certify that it is able to build the product within the budgetary constraints of the Government? See size estimate of team as indicated in the draft Statements of Objectives.

The bullet points below relate back to the Digital Services Playbook.  

Play 1 – Understand What People Need
  * We have identified the primary users of our service, and we conduct formal user research with these users. These users must be real users of the product or service, and must not be a small set of pre-designated Subject Matter Experts.
  * We have recently conducted qualitative research (e.g. contextual inquiries, user interviews, on-site observations) for our customers/clients including their users, and have iterated on our implementation plan based on the findings.
  * Through user research directly with users, we have documented and analyzed findings about goals, needs, behaviors, and preferences, and continually refer to the findings to shape the product.
  
Play 2 – Address the Whole Experience from Start to Finish
  * Through direct user research, we understand user motivations as they use the service we provide.
  * We document all the steps users need to go through to achieve an outcome or goal, across any channels (online, in person, on the phone, etc) in a series of journey maps or service blueprints that capture the touchpoints we are responsible for. This includes a “happy path” as well as what happens if something goes wrong.
  * Through research with our users and internal service providers, we have identified the pain points in the current way the service is delivered and prioritized these according to greatest user need and internal dependencies.
  * We have built out touchpoints to help a user recover when the service breaks or if their needs fall out of the normal happy path.
  
Play 3 – Make it Simple and Intuitive
  * The products or services for our customers/clients do not require knowledge of the organizational structure or our agency to complete the process.
  * We coordinated with our customers/clients to make design and content decisions based on accessibility needs, user research, usability testing, and analytics.
  * For all user-facing features built recently, we coordinated with our customers/clients to use plain language that is familiar to the user, easy to understand, and possible to translate across cultures and languages.
  
Play 4 – Build the Service Using Agile and Iterative Practices
  * For at least half of the projects/products for our customers/clients we launched a functioning “minimum viable product” (MVP), using a “beta” or “test” period if needed.
  * We ensure the individuals building the service (product managers, developers, designers) communicate closely with each other throughout the process using techniques such as daily standups, launch meetings, and team chat tools.
  * We release features and improvements multiple times each month for at least half of the projects/products for our customers/clients.
  * We maintain a prioritized list of features and bugs, also known as a “backlog,” in an issue tracker that is accessible by everyone on the project.
  * We use a source code version control system.
  * We use code reviews to ensure quality for each release.

Play 7 – Bring in Experienced Teams

Our company's team include:
  * Product managers who have built and launched user-centered, high-traffic digital services in previous projects.
  * User experience designer(s) who have conducted one-on-one sessions with end users to understand user needs and translated those needs into a design for the digital service in previous projects.
  * Art directors who have experience with branding, interaction design, movement, and animation.
  * Content strategist(s) who are able to turn project objectives and content audits into editorial calendars, style guides, taxonomies, metadata frameworks, and content migration plans.
  * Copywriters who have experience crafting stories and who have developed user-centered, plain-language content in previous projects.
  * Software engineer(s) who have used modern development and operations (DevOps) techniques like continuous integration and continuous deployment.
  
Play 8 – Choose a Modern Technology Stack
  * We use modern development tools that enable our software engineers to be effective and allow for adoption of emerging tools.
  * We use software frameworks that are commonly used by modern private-sector companies.
  * Our projects have clear, understandable instructions for setting up a local development environment, which a new developer can use to create a working development instance in less than one day.
  * Our application is built using open source software solutions at every layer of the stack.
  
Play 9 – Deploy in a Flexible Hosting Environment  
  * We provisioned additional servers or instances for production usage utilizing standard approaches which minimized deployment times over the past year.
  * Where necessary, and possible, we enabled all servers/instances to automatically scale based on real-time demands, without any human intervention.
  * At least half of our customer/client projects/products are currently deployed in a test environment that mirrors the production environment.
  
Play 10 – Automate Testing and Deployments
  * At least half of our customer/client projects/products follow software build processes which automatically run automated tests to verify functionality and prevent bugs or broken functionality from being released.
  
Play 11 – Manage security and privacy through reusable processes
We bring experience 
  * Determining what data is collected and why, how it is used or shared, how it is stored and secured, and how long it is kept
  * Determining whether and how users are notified about how personal information is collected and used, including whether a privacy policy is needed and where it should appear, how users will be notified in the event of a security breach, and ensuring GDPR compliance
  * Considering whether the user should be able to access, delete, or remove their information from the service


Play 12 – Use Data to Drive Decisions

For our customers/clients:
  * We have developed automated alerts based on monitoring.
  * We have implemented tools to track concurrent users in real-time, and to understand how users, in the aggregate, use our service.
  * We have established user metrics (e.g. user satisfaction) for the customer’s/client’s service, including baseline measurements, targets, and timeframes.
  
Play 13 – Default to Open
  * Our customer/client maintains contractual rights to all custom software developed by our company, including the right to publish or reuse it at no additional cost.
  * Whenever possible the source code developed for our customers’/clients’ application is stored in a publicly-visible code repository, and that repository is currently used by existing developers as they build features.
