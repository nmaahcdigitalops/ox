__DRAFT STATEMENT OF QUALIFICATION__  

The Smithsonian Institution (SI) intends to release a Request for Proposal on or around 11/12/2019 for a Digital Minimum Viable Product for Slavery and Freedom. Interested vendors shall follow the steps below. This posting is not a Request for Proposal. The purpose of this Statement of Qualification is to encourage participation in this procurement from only those vendors who have a solid commitment to building technology for their government clients according to the Digital Services Playbook. Vendors who may not yet have this commitment are strongly DISCOURAGED to respond because they are not the best fit.

1. Respond with a 3-page (maximum) Statement of Qualifications via email to (fill in here) within 15 calendar days of this posting (by 9:00AM EST). You may place the information in an MS Word document or PDF file format.  
2. For background information, see the draft Statements of Objectives, the draft Request for Proposal, and other additional information in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/nmaahcdigital/ox/tree/master/sf/draft%20procurement.  
3. The Government intends to review responses to this qualifications statement, and will provide the anticipated Request for Proposal to only those vendors whom the government has decided has met the minimum qualifications.  
4. Minimum Qualifications: Only vendors that respond 'yes' to all of the below bullet points will receive the eventual Request for Proposal and will be allowed to participate in this procurement. Next to each bullet point below, answer 'yes' to indicate that the statement is true for your company or indicate 'no' to indicate that the statement is not completely true for your company. If the prime contractor is anticipating partnering with another company (including a sub-contractor), submit a separate response for them as well and indicate the arrangement between the two companies so that the Government can easily understand the relationship between those companies.  

The bullet points below ensure that the size of the vendor is adequate for this particular work, and that the anticipated price proposal is in the same 'ballpark' as the government budget.  

* Is your company adequately sized to successfully deliver the digital product (15 FTEs minimum for the whole company size)? Clarification: This question is about the overall size of your company and not about the potential team size dedicated to this particularr work.
* Is your company able to build the product within the budgetary constraints of the Government (see size estimate of team as indicated in the draft Statements of Objectives)?

Vendors must cerfify that they have provided services in accordance with the below bullet points (mapped to the Digital Services Playbook).   

Play 1 – Understand What People Need  
      *	We have identified the primary users all of our projects, and we conduct formal user research with these users regularly. These users must be real users of the product or service, and must not be a small set of pre-designated Subject Matter Experts.
      * Over the last quarter, we have conducted qualitative research (e.g. contextual inquiries, user interviews, on-site observations) with our customer’s/client’s users and have changed our implementation plan as needed based on the findings.
      * Through user research performed directly with end-users, we have documented and analyzed findings about user goals, needs, behaviors, and preferences, and continually refer to the findings to shape the product we and our customer/client built.
      * As the digital service is being built, we regularly test it with potential users to ensure it meets the needs of end users.
  
Play 2 – Address the Whole Experience from Start to Finish
  * Through direct user research, we understand user motivations as they use the service we provide.
  * We document all the steps users need to go through to achieve an outcome or goal, across any channels (online, in person, on the phone, etc) in a series of journey maps or service blueprints that capture the touchpoints we are responsible for. This includes a “happy path” as well as what happens if something goes wrong.
  * Through research with our users and internal service providers, we have identified the pain points in the current way the service is delivered and prioritized these according to greatest user need and internal dependencies.
  * We have built out touchpoints to help a user recover when the service breaks or if their needs fall out of the normal happy path.
  
Play 3 – Make it Simple and Intuitive
  * The products or services for our customers/clients do not require knowledge of the organizational structure or our agency to complete the process.
  * We coordinated with our customers/clients to make design and content decisions based on user research, usability testing, and analytics.
  * For all user-facing features built over the last quarter, we coordinated with our customers/clients to use plain language that is familiar to the user, easy to understand__, and possible to translate across cultures and languages.__
  
Play 4 – Build the Service Using Agile and Iterative Practices
  * For at least ½ of the projects/products for our customers/clients we launched a functioning “minimum viable product” (MVP) that took no longer than nine months from the beginning of the project, using a “beta” or “test” period if needed.
  * We ensure the individuals building the service (product managers, developers, designers) communicate closely with each other throughout the process using techniques such as daily standups, launch meetings, and team chat tools.
  * We release features and improvements multiple times each month for at least ½ of the projects/products for our customers/clients.
  * We maintain a prioritized list of features and bugs, also known as a “backlog,” in an issue tracker that is accessible by everyone on the project.
  * We use a source code version control system.
  * We use code reviews to ensure quality for each release.

Play 7 – Bring in Experienced Teams
  * Our company’s teams include product managers who have built and launched user-centered, high-traffic digital services in previous projects. Our product managers understand how to work with clients and cross-functional teams and evolve solutions based on goals, needs, and constraints.
  * Our company’s teams include user experience researcher(s) and designer(s) who have conducted one-on-one sessions with end users to understand user needs and translated those needs into a design for the digital service in previous projects.
  * Our company currently has content strategist(s) who have developed user-centered, plain-language content in previous projects, and who are able to turn project objectives and content audits into editorial calendars, style guides, taxonomies, metadata frameworks, and content migration plans.
  * Our company includes software engineer(s) who have used modern development and operations (DevOps) techniques like continuous integration and continuous deployment.
  
Play 8 – Choose a Modern Technology Stack
  * We use modern development tools that enable our software engineers to be effective and allow for adoption of emerging tools.
  * We use software frameworks that are commonly used by modern private-sector companies.
  * Our projects have clear, understandable instructions for setting up a local development environment, which a new developer can use to create a working development instance in less than one day after the developer has been approved with compliance and security background checks.
  * We default to open source software solutions in our technical stacks, using open source solutions at every layer of the stack when client/customer security and confidentiality standards allow.
  
Play 9 – Deploy in a Flexible Hosting Environment  
  * For at least ¼ of the projects/products for our customers/clients over the last quarter (of a year), any time we provisioned additional servers or instances for production usage, it took less than two hours.
  * In the last quarter, we have verified that for at least ¼ of the projects/products for our customers/clients, the servers or instances automatically scale based on real-time demand, without any human intervention.
  * Half or more of the projects/products for our customers/clients the application are currently deployed in a test environment that mirrors the production environment.
  
Play 10 – Automate Testing and Deployments
  * Currently, half or more of the projects/products for our customers/clients follow software build processes which automatically run automated tests to verify functionality and prevent bugs or broken functionality from being released.
  * Over the last quarter, we conducted load and performance tests to validate that the production system can function correctly while being used by more users than the expected average.
  * We collaborate with our customers/clients to create, document, and run repeatable test cases that reflect the customer’s acceptance criteria and cover critical end user interactions.
  
Play 12 – Use Data to Drive Decisions
  * For our customers/clients we have developed automated alerts based on monitoring.
  * We have implemented tools to track concurrent users in real-time, and to understand how users, in the aggregate, use our service.
  * We have established user metrics (e.g. user satisfaction) for the customer’s/client’s service, including baseline measurements, targets, and timeframes. That data is heavily relied upon for decision-making purposes.
  * For our customers/clients, we have developed the ability to deploy multiple variations of the same feature or enable/disable a feature in order to test the impact of a feature and/or reduce the risk of a new feature.
  
Play 13 – Default to Open
  * Our customer/client maintains contractual rights to all custom software developed by our company, including the right to publish or reuse it at no additional cost.
  * As a default and where permitted by the client/customer, the source code developed for our customers’/clients’ application is stored in a publicly-visible code repository, and that repository is currently used by existing developers as they build features.
